LEARNED ABOUT FOLLOWING THINGS
TUPLE= Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.,A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.Tuples are written with round brackets.
SLICING=The slice() function returns a slice object.A slice object is used to specify how to slice a sequence. You can specify where to start the slicing, and where to end. You can also specify the step,
SET= Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.Sets are written with curly brackets.
COMPARISION OPERATORS= Equal To Operator in python. Not Equal To Operator in python. Greater Than Operator in python. Less Than Operator in python.
LOGICAL OPERATOR=Logical Operators or Bitwise Operators.
Logical operators in Python are used for conditional statements are true or false. Logical operators in Python are AND, OR and NOT.
ELIF,IF,ELSE CONDITION=he elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions. If the condition for if is False , it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on. If all the conditions are False , the body of else is executed.
FOR-LOOP=for loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The for-loop is always used in combination with an iterable object, like a list or a range. 
MAP=Python's map() is a built-in function that allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable without using an explicit for loop, a technique commonly known as mapping. map() is useful when you need to apply a transformation function to each item in an iterable and transform them into a new iterable.
FILTER=The filter() function returns an iterator were the items are filtered through a function to test if the item is accepted or not.
